A solver made for LinkedIn Queens game using JavaScript, Python, Flask, and Gurobi. 

Run the website application using:
```
python server.py
```
In your browser, access: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Create the grid, color it, and hit solve. The Gurobi optimization model will process the information and will either present the solution, which will then be used to mark crowns on the grid, or will say the model is infeasible, which will then be used to alert you.
